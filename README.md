# WebSocketPOC
This Proof of Concept demonstrates real‑time ride status tracking for the Nagara Metered Auto platform using WebSockets. The application establishes a persistent WebSocket connection between the server and client to stream live ride updates (such as booking confirmation, driver arrival, trip start, trip in‑progress, and trip completed).
